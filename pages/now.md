What have I been up to?

... and [what is a now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?

## Personally

About to celebrate my first wedding anniversary with my best friend. In the process of buying a home- a huge task that is 100% in order to give our cute dog and fluffy cat better lives.

Making different versions of this website over and over because I think it's fun. It's fun to try new things.

Dreaming of a day when I can work from home so I can hang out with my furry babies 24/7.

## Professionally

Building tons of websites for Fusion Marketing, an experimental marketing member of the Endeavor Global Marketing family.

Practicing CSS witchcraft and passing on that magic to my colleagues.
