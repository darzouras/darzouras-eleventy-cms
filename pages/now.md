What have I been up to?

... and [what is a now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?

## Personally

Just celebrated the first wedding anniversary with my best friend. Just bought an old house and we're enjoying every bit of it.

Making different versions of this website over and over because I think it's fun.

Dreaming of a day when I can work from home so I can hang out with my furry babies 24/7.

## Professionally

Building TONS of websites for [160/90](https://160over90.com). Practicing CSS witchcraft and passing on that magic to my colleagues.

Recently promoted to UX Developer, working out of the St Louis office.
