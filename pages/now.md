What have I been up to?

... and [what is a now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?

## Personally

Enjoying the first spring in my new home with my husband and tending to a small vegetable garden. Every weekend I'm busy tending to our huge yard.

Recently went from vegetarian to full vegan. The current state of animal aggriculture is unsustainable. I'm trying to do my part for the environment by refraining from animal products.

Dreaming of a day when I can work from home so I can hang out with my furry babies 24/7.

## Professionally
