What have I been up to?

... and [what is a now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?

## Personally

Enjoying the first spring in my new home with my husband and tending to a small vegetable garden.

Recently went from vegetarian to full vegan. The current state of animal agriculture is unsustainable. I'm trying to do my part for the environment by refraining from animal products.

Dreaming of a day when I can work from home so I can hang out with my furry babies 24/7.

## Professionally

Building TONS of websites for [160 over 90](https://160over90.com). Practicing CSS witchcraft and passing my magic to willing colleagues. Helping assess web projects built across the 160/90 digital teams on web accessibility. Also doing a little bit of web design.

Studying for the [Web Accessibility Standards certification exam](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/wascertification).
