title: To test on this site
summary: A list of goals for this website.
---
I'm at the [An Event Apart](https://aneventapart.com) conference in Chicago, having a great time and learning a lot. I started this personal site rebuild after being inspired by some of the talks the past two days. It's my goal to learn more about these and put them to use on this site:

* Add a service worker!
* Design with a variable font!
* Build using intrinsic web design techniques
