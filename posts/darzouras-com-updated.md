summary: Nearly complete with the rebuild of my personal site. Here's what's different.

It's day one of a four day weekend and I'm neck deep in the rebuild of my personal website. Just in case you haven't seen it before the rebuild, this is what you were missing:

As I'm writing this blog post there are a few things that I've already updated:

* I'm using CSS variables!!! I can't believe I went so long not knowing about them. They're so cool and I can't wait to use them for work.
* I've added a Service Worker and manifest!! I haven't been able to get the page to successfully load while offline yet so I'm still working on it. Still would like to build a page for offline purposes only.
* I'm using a variable font!! Right now I'm working with Public Sans but I'm considering switching to something that has variant options besides just the weight.

Of course the layout itself is updated as well- I've been playing with this style since I [built a test site using Gatsby](https://darzouras-gatsby.netlify.com).
